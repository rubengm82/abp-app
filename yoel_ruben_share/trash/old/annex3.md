## Annex 3 – Selection of Architectures and Programming Technologies in JavaScript for Web Clients

### Objectives

Students will be able to identify and analyze the architectures and programming technologies used in the development of client-side web applications, focusing on JavaScript.

### Introduction

A crucial part of web development is the selection of client-side technologies and programming architectures. This is fundamental for creating interactive and efficient web applications.
Choosing the right technologies for a project can have a significant impact on its success. Different technologies offer different advantages and disadvantages, and it is important to understand what they do and how they can benefit the project.
In this activity, students will research various JavaScript-based technologies and programming architectures used in client-side web development.

### Concepts

1. **Architecture**: In the context of web development, architecture refers to how an application or website is designed and organized. It involves the general structure and arrangement of components, parts, and logic. Common architectures include three-tier (3-layer) or MVC architecture, monolithic architecture, and microservices architecture. Each has advantages and disadvantages and is chosen according to the project’s needs.

2. **Technology**: Technology refers to the programming languages, libraries, platforms, and tools used to develop an application or website. In web development, this includes technologies such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, Angular, Vue.js, and Node.js, among others. Each technology has specific functions and uses, and the choice depends on the project’s needs and objectives.

### Research

#### 1. Context and Objective of the Web Client

* Define the role of JavaScript code in your project.
* Indicate which parts of the website are updated or improved thanks to JavaScript (e.g., filters, validations, dynamic forms, menus, etc.).
* Briefly justify why client-side interactivity is needed.

#### 2. Architecture Used (MVC + JS)

Explain how your JavaScript integrates into this architecture:

* Where it executes.
* How it communicates with the controller.
* A practical example of an action in your project where the client sends or receives data without reloading the page.
* Include a small diagram of the data flow between client and server.

#### 3. Chosen Technologies and Tools

* **Vite**: Describe how it is used to compile and optimize JS and CSS.
* **JavaScript Libraries**: Indicate which one you use (e.g., Alpine.js, native JS) and its purpose within the project.
* **npm and File Structure**: Briefly mention how dependencies and code organization are managed (e.g., files under `resources/js`).

#### 4. Best Practices and Optimization

* How the code has been organized to keep it clean and modular.
* Techniques applied to improve performance or user experience (lazy loading, minification, visual feedback, etc.).
* If any additional libraries are used (e.g., SweetAlert, Chart.js), explain why.
